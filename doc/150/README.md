### VCF files

Location: ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net/genomes/tomato_150/

Tomato 150 .vcf files, mapped from SL2.40 to SL2.50 using SGN's 
[Bio-GenomeUpdate tools](https://github.com/solgenomics/Bio-GenomeUpdate)

Please see http://www.tomatogenome.net/accessions.html for the code for each accession and its description.  
The directory number corresponds to the "Nr" column on the spreadsheet found at this website which is a code for the accession name.

#### Sep 6, 2016

We have updated the SL2.50 VCF files with corrected ref and alt alleles for scaffolds flipped in SL2.50. We would like to thank 
Tomasz Kurowski and Andreu Paytuvi for reporting this error.
