t-SNE analysis
==============

In a first pass to place the _En Tibi_ among wild relatives and neotropical land races
and cultivars we performed a t-SNE analysis, which is a dimensionality reduction method
somewhat like PCA.

The analysis is performed in R and is recorded in [README.Rmd](README.Rmd), including
the links to the input data files. The output is plotted as [tsne.pdf](tsne.pdf).
