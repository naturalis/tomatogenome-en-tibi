mapDamage analysis
==================

This analysis is performed on the 
[aligned nuclear genome](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4966843) BAM file using the
mapDamage toolkit. The program was run as recorded in the [log](Runtime_log.txt).
This directory stores all the various outputs that are generated. The easiest to
interpret is the misincorporation [plot](Fragmisincorporation_plot.pdf), which
demonstrates that the DNA has indeed been subject to ancient DNA decay processes.
